# AdminAssist

The program is far from stable version. Still working on remote features.
For now it can display basic information about your computer: 
- hardware you're running on
- Ip settings and route table

The script is based on WMI, so it will run only on Windows.


## Requirements:
- libraries: tabulate, wmi.
- python 3.7 or higher
